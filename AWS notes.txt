AWS
cloud deployment models
global cloud platform 


key concepts 
1. Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS) - provides max. control

2. Hybrid (Platform as a Service (PaaS) - combo

3. Software as a Service (SaaS) - minimum maintenance 

4. Cloud storage platform 

- per hour billing 
- easy sign up
- 
AWS global infrastructure

EC2 - elastic compute cloud
gives you AWS servers 

VPC - virtual private cloud 
create networks in the cloud and then run your servers in the networks

S3 - simple storage service
let's you upload and share/store files

RDS - relational database service 
SQL server, oracle, PostGres ....etc.

Route 53
DNS service (global)

ELB - elastic load balancing 

autoscaling

Stats and probability for ML by Janani Ravi

discrete data - info. that can only take certain values (i.e. fixed values) - data is best shown on bar or pie charts

continuous data - can take any value and can change over time - data is best shown on a line graph 

measure of central tendency 
mean - single best value to represent data (b/c considers every point in data), but vulnerable to outliers
depict via boxplot 

median - value such that 50% of data on either side (i.e. sort data and then retrieve middle value)
more robust to outliers, but doesn't consider every data point 

mode - most frequent value in a dataset 
depict via histogram
typically used with categorical data 
not great for continuous data. the data would need to be discretized and binned first before computing mode.

Measures of dispersion 
1. range (max-min). but ignores the mean and influenced by outliers
2. IQR
3. SD (aka square root of var) and Var (considers the mean)
