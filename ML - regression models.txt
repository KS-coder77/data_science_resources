In machine learning, regression models are used to predict continuous numerical values based on input features. Here are some common regression model options:

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - Simple and widely used regression model.
   - Assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.
   - Variants include:
     - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression
     - Ridge Regression
     - Lasso Regression
     - Elastic Net Regression

2. **Decision Tree Regression**:
   - Builds a decision tree to recursively partition the feature space into smaller regions and predicts the average target value within each region.
   - Prone to overfitting, but techniques like pruning and limiting tree depth can help.

3. **Random Forest Regression**:
   - Ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees.
   - Each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data and/or features.
   - Provides better generalization performance compared to a single decision tree.

4. **Gradient Boosting Regression**:
   - Ensemble learning technique where trees are built sequentially, with each tree correcting the errors of the previous ones.
   - Popular implementations include:
     - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
     - XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
     - LightGBM
     - CatBoost

5. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**:
   - Extension of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for regression tasks.
   - Finds the hyperplane that maximizes the margin while minimizing the error on training data.

6. **Neural Network Regression**:
   - Utilizes artificial neural networks to learn complex patterns in the data.
   - Can handle large amounts of data and capture nonlinear relationships.
   - Variants include:
     - Feedforward Neural Networks
     - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for regression
     - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time series regression

7. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression**:
   - Instance-based learning method that predicts the target value for a new data point by averaging the target values of its k nearest neighbors.

8. **Gaussian Process Regression**:
   - Probabilistic model that models the distribution over functions.
   - Provides uncertainty estimates along with predictions.

9. **Polynomial Regression**:
   - Fits a polynomial function to the data instead of a straight line, allowing for more flexible fits.

10. **Bayesian Regression**:
    - Applies Bayesian inference to regression tasks, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge and uncertainty estimates.

The choice of regression model depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, the complexity of the relationship between features and target, computational resources, interpretability requirements, and the need for uncertainty estimates. It's often a good idea to try multiple models and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics before selecting the best one for the task at hand.
