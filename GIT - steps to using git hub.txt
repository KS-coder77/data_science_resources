steps to using git hub 

clone a repo - make a copy of the repo in your system

fork a repo - means you are copying the repo to your github account 

pull a repo - means you are fetching the last modified repo

push a repo - means you are returning the repo after modifying it 

commit a repo - means you are saving repo changes on local system not remnote repo.


IF REPO CREATED ON GITHUB 
1. pull repo in github desktop
2. open jupyter notebook and make edits 
3. fetch repo in github desktop (marries any changes made in notebook)
4. when edits complete - download jupyter notebook as py file. move py file to project folder and commit to main in github desktop and push to github as py file NOT pynb. 

IF CREATING A NEW REPO ON GITHUB 
1. clone to local system first, then continue with steps 2 - 4 above.
